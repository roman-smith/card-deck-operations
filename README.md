# card-deck-operations
Class: CSE 205 - Assignment: 2
Description: I wrote this Java program from scratch for my CSE 205 class in order to practice my object-oriented programming, file I/O, and arrayList skills. I created the Card class in Card.java and the Deck class in Deck.java which contains objects of Card class in an arrayList and a few Deck methods. I make an object of Deck class in Assn2.java. The program gives the user the option to create a standard deck or create a custom deck by reading from a file. If the custom option is chosen, the program asks the user to enter the file they would like to build the deck from. Files test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt, and test5.txt are sample files to be called. In both the custom and standard cases, two new Deck objects are made--one to represent the main deck and the other to represent the user's hand--and the user can then choose from various operations to do, such as drawing a card, replacing a card, and shuffling the deck. I use arrayList manipulations to simulate these actions.
